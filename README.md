# Exploratory-data-analysis-projet
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is applied to investigate the data and summarize the key insights. It will give you the basic understanding of your data, itâ€™s distribution, null values and much more. It enables an in depth understanding of the dataset, define or discard hypotheses and create predictive models on a solid basis.It uses data manipulation techniques and several statistical tools to describe and understand the relationship between variables and how these can impact business.

# Problem statement
Performance of the student is the consider as the bench mark for the students acedemic career.Here,the purpose of this project is to master the exploratory data analysis (EDA) in 'Student Performance Prediciton' with Pandas framework.

# Goals of the Project
1.Explore the 'Student Performance Prediciton' dataset with pandas framework.                                                                                     
2.Build the pivot tables.                                                                                                                                         
3.Visualize the dataset and plot various graphs.                                                                                                                   
4.Make the conclusions of dataset.                                                                                                                                 

# objective
In this project,'we will try to give answers to a set of questions that may be relevant when analyzing examination data:                                           
how the students are attatched to the score data?                                                                                                                 
What are the mean values of numerical features among the scores?                                                                                                   
how the parents qualification is attatched to the students score?                                                                                                 
what is the realtionship between eating food to the score of the student?                                                                                         
How ethanicity affect the performance of the student?                                                                                                             
check the possibilty of any more attribute we can add?                                                                                                             
In addition, we will make a visual analysis in order to plan marketing banking campaigns more effectively.

# Conclusion
As examination is based on reading, writng and math ,all skills are higly correlated to each other.                                                               
Students those are female able to score more than male students.                                                                                                   
Students those have good parental qualification are able to perform well in examination.It shows that they are having good environment for the studies.           
As food impact the health of the body, Students those eat standard food rather than free or reduced price food performs good.                                     
Though 'test prepation course' is quite helpful for student's performance in examination, Very less students are there those completed the Course.
